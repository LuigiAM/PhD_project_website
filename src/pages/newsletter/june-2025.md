The sun is shining (sometimes), but we're still working hard behind the scenes to bring this project to life! June marked an exciting turning point in the MEMoPAD journey, with our digital tool starting to take shape and a major new phase of co-design underway.

**🪁 Phase IV: Reviewing the Demo Begins!**
The fourth phase of our co-design has officially started! Invitations have just gone out to our participants. In this round, we’re reviewing the first demo of MEMoPAD, designed based on all the amazing insights and ideas you’ve shared so far.
This phase is crucial: we’ll use it to better understand which features are most valuable to include in the working prototype, and which might be better saved for future versions.
Curious to see what MEMoPAD looks like in action? Check out this short teaser video of the app here:

If you haven’t received an invitation but would like to take part in this phase, please don’t hesitate to get in touch, we’d love to hear from you!

**📱 Prototype Development – A Milestone with Louis**
We’re also thrilled to share that we’ve made remarkable progress on the technical side of the project, especially with the help of Louis, the engineering student who joined us through a UWE-sponsored internship.
Over the past few months, Louis has focused on a key challenge: connecting the selected wearable devices with smartphones, a critical step in enabling MEMoPAD to collect and process data.
This work forms the foundation of the working prototype we aim to complete by the end of this year. Once ready, this version will be tested during Phase V and further refined based on your co-design insights. 

**🎖️ Sharing Our Work: CHCR Poster Presentation**
Earlier this month, we had the opportunity to present our work at the Centre for Health and Clinical Research (CHCR) Annual Showcase Conference at UWE Bristol.
This event brought together colleagues across clinical research fields, and we were proud to present a poster summarising key findings from Phases I and II of our co-design journey.

**🌐 Our Website is Live – And Hosting This Newsletter!**
To celebrate one year of this newsletter, we’ve moved it to its new home: our project website, which has received a major update since it first launched last month!
You can now read all about the MEMoPAD project, explore our co-design process, and -most importantly- share it with others. Whether you’re a participant, clinician, or any other kind of stakeholder, the website is a great way to help others understand what we’re building and how they can get involved.
