**Revised recruitment materials:** For those of you who took part in our initial consultations to review the recruitment materials (flyers and one-page presentations), you may be interested to see the new version we have designed based on your valuable advice and feedback. Please find them attached and do not hesitate to share them with anyone who might be interested.

**A growing interest:** This month we have reached out to new communities, both thanks to the flyers posted around the UWE campuses, and to the support of people who are committed to spreading the word about the project (once again a special thanks to Carmel McGrath).

**Co-design with clinicians:** Due to difficulties in organising workshops with clinicians before and after the summer, we decided to switch to 1to1 online interviews for clinician involvement. We would have liked to have had a similar approach for all stakeholders, but we also need to be pragmatic: clinicians are very interested but lack time and their agenda is often unpredictable. If you know of professionals with experience of anxiety disorders who might be interested, please encourage them to contact us at [*luigi.moretti@uwe.ac.uk](mailto:luigi.moretti@uwe.ac.uk)*

**Collaboration within the University:** After successfully testing this approach last year at both UWE with Dr David Western and UoB with Dr Zahraa Abdallah, we have put out a call for Masters students from different programmes to work with us on different aspects of the project: from developing technology to co-facilitating workshops.

**Technical side:** we have made some progress in collecting data from commercial wearable devices. This is great news as it expands the models we can consider in our co-design! We'll continue to test and experiment to ensure the reliability and interpretability of these data sources.

**Looking ahead:** As anticipated, October will be a light month for our team, with no co-design workshops but other activities running in the background.

Looking forward to seeing you soon, and thank you for your enthusiasm and involvement!
