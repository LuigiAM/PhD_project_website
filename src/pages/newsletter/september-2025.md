**💡 Project Updates & What's Next**
While we are finalising the analysis and implementation of Phase IV insights, we are also deeping in the planning stages for Phase V of our co-design journey! This next phase will be quite different from our previous workshops. We're taking the time needed to design the best possible experience for our participants while ensuring the data we collect is scientifically robust and meaningful.

In parallel, we are thrilled to be working on a new project in partnership with HUG (the creators of science-backed hugging puppets) and Milbotix (innovators of a smart sock). There will be opportunities for you to take part in this study, which shares some exciting similarities with MEMoPAD's Phase V. We’ll keep you updated as these two projects develop alongside each other!

On the tech front, we are dedicating the next month to fine-tuning our prototype's data collection capabilities, making sure we can capture the data that matters most for our research. ⚙️

**🎬 Behind the Scenes & Celebrations!**
Earlier this month, David Western and I attended the 3rd Multimodal AI Workshop in London, organised by the University of Sheffield and The Alan Turing Institute. It was a fantastic opportunity to connect and brainstorm with researchers from across the Country and beyond. We left feeling incredibly inspired by new ideas for MEMoPAD's technical development!

On a personal (and very fun) note, I was awarded the prize for the 'best human picture' representing multimodal AI! Inspired by our work, my entry was a humorous representation of a 'Human-based Multisensory Model for Feline Emotion Detection'. 🐈

**👥 LEAP Digital Health Community Innovators**
A core value of the MEMoPAD project is co-design, building with the people we aim to support. That's why we want to share with you the Digital Health Community Innovators scheme, in case you have ideas to solve local health challenges with technology. Successful applicants get to work with a researcher, develop their idea, and present it at a "Community Sandpit" event in November. You could even secure a grant to bring your vision to life. 
The deadline is fast approaching: Monday, 6 October 2025. More info here: [LEAP Digital Health Community Innovators | LEAP Digital Health Hub](https://leap-hub.ac.uk/funded-fellowship-patient-generated-data/)

**📚 Resources & Extras**
I’m delighted to share that a paper I co-authored, led by Tom Draper, has been published in the BMJ Health & Care Informatics journal!

While not directly about MEMoPAD, it explores 'Clinical AI Scribes in Primary Care' and touches on topics like the automatic summary of clinical meetings, a feature we have discussed in our co-design sessions. It might be an interesting read to see the current state of this technology.
