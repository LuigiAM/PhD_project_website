**📝 Wrapping Up Phase I: Insights & Expert Roundtable**

We’ve now completed an in-depth **qualitative analysis** of all the workshops and interviews conducted in recent months. This involved:

✔️ **Comparing perspectives** across different stakeholder groups (patients, carers, clinicians) to identify common ground and key differences.

✔️ **Highlighting critical insights** that must be addressed in the next phase.

✔️ **Hosting a roundtable** with experts from multiple disciplines to discuss these findings and strategize how to carry them forward into Phase II.

This has been an eye-opening process, and we are now in a strong position to move forward with designing potential solutions!

**🚀 Phase II: Idea Generation Has Begun!**

Last Friday, we **sent invitations to all our participants** to take part in the next set of activities, which will focus on generating solution ideas to address the needs identified in Phase I.

Participants in Phase II will receive:

📌 A **brief overview of insights from Phase I.**

📌 A **snapshot of current technological advancements in emotion detection.**

**📌 Devices and Data Modalities we might consider for our ideas generation.**

As in Phase I, all Phase II activities will take place **fully remotely and online:**

🔹 **Patients:** 2-hour workshops, over the 3rd week of April.

🔹 **Carers & Clinicians:** 30-minute one-to-one interviews, from the 2nd to the 3rd week of April.

If you’re interested in getting involved, please feel free to reach out!

**🎪 Behind the Scenes: Progress & Milestones**

💡 **Conference Paper Now Publicly Available!** You can access it here: [Affective_Computing_in_Anxiety_Disorders_A_Rapid_Literature_Review_of_Emotion_Recognition_Applications](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389361853_Affective_Computing_in_Anxiety_Disorders_A_Rapid_Literature_Review_of_Emotion_Recognition_Applications#fullTextFileContent)

💡 **Advancing Technological Developments** – We continue refining our technology to ensure it aligns with the directions our co-design process will highlight.

💡 **Celebrating Positivity!** Last week, I successfully passed my **annual PhD review**, which means everything is progressing well and as planned. We can continue our work without any modifications to the project, great news for me and all involved! 🎉
