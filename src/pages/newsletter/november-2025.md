description: 'MEMoPAD is transitioning from design to deployment + A 2-minute animated story showing how our technology for mental health works in daily life'
---

As we head into the final stretch of 2025, MEMoPAD is transitioning from design to deployment. November feels like the shift from "what could this be done?" to "let's test if it works."

** 🎦 Seeing MEMoPAD in a Movie (Sort Of) **
What does wearable emotion monitoring actually look like in daily life? I created an animated story to show how MEMoPAD could help, following Alex from anxiety overwhelm to early pattern detection to peer support. It's the closest I can get to showing MEMoPAD's vision in two minutes.
Watch it at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uJHqtzO6cw and don't hesitate to share your feedback!

** 📋 Co-design Phase V Protocol Finalized **
We've defined the study protocol for Phase V and will run simulations in December to test our prototype in deployment conditions.
Phase V launches early 2026. If you've expressed interest in participating, stay tuned, we'll be in touch soon.

** 📄 Position Paper Now Available **
Our co-design position paper is now published: "Co-Designing MEMoPAD: Multimodal Emotion Monitoring in Clinical Pathways for Anxiety Disorders."
This covers the first three stages of our co-design journey and was presented at the 'Co-Designing Human-Centred AI Technologies for Health and Wellbeing' workshop at HCI 2025.
Thanks to my co-authors Carmel McGrath, Lucy Condon, Miles Thompson, Paul Matthews, Michael Loizou, and David Western; as well as to the workshop organizers for creating space for this work. Read the paper here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zStNmaGHpnxizDS_yjEucyk30WLvm1WV/view 

** 🌍 Contributing to WHO Europe Regulation Discussions **
I'm participating in WHO Europe's Knowledge Community on digital mental health regulation (voluntarily, unpaid).
I've proposed two frameworks that aim to balance patient safety with innovation speed, a tension anyone building regulated health tech knows well:
"Embedded regulatory co-design" where regulators observe and advice over the co-design journey → https://www.linkedin.com/posts/luigiandreamoretti_digitalmentalhealth-medicaldeviceregulation-share-7396576389388443648-m75n?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BWC9ncStERWW0wRePAvSrAw%3D%3D

** 🧦 HUG & SmartSocks Project Update **
Ethics approval secured at the first shot, as it was for MEMoPAD Phase V! This side project exploring sensory comfort devices and smart wearable sensors is moving forward. Expect more information and participation opportunities soon.

** 🎓 For International Students in Innovation **
Potentially good news for your future in the UK. From 25 November 2025, UK international students can switch to the Innovator Founder visa from inside the UK, provided they have completed their course or 24 months of a PhD. Key requirements include securing an endorsement from an approved body for an innovative, viable, and scalable business, meeting B2 English language and maintenance fund requirements, and demonstrating growth potential.
