**Funding Progress**
A big thank you to everyone who shared their thoughts in support of our project for the LEAP funding. Despite a very low success rate this year (under 10%), our project wasn’t selected in the final round. However, we are still awaiting feedback and actively pursuing additional funding sources to support our co-design work.

**Research and Publication Efforts**
We’re also working on a publication that explores what has already been done in the field, providing valuable insights into past successes, challenges, and recent technological advances. Understanding this landscape is essential for all of us, and we look forward to sharing this work with you in the coming months.

**Exploring Wearable Devices**
To enhance our work on this project, we’re reaching out to several companies that produce wearable devices, aiming to offer you the opportunity to explore different tools and give feedback on what would be most useful and comfortable for you in future sessions.

**Upcoming Sessions**
Our efforts to secure funding to ensure fair compensation for all co-design participants have temporarily adjusted our initial roadmap. However, we’ll be announcing dates for the next co-design sessions in the coming weeks. These will include group workshops and online interviews, tailored respectively for the public and clinicians.

**Extra Inspiration: Inside Out 2**

Recently, I came across the Disney Pixar movie *Inside Out 2 ([trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4DrolmDxmw))*, and thought it might be interesting to share. This animated film brings emotions to life as quirky characters, with the second installment focusing on a young girl entering adolescence and encountering anxiety for the first time. The movie nicely shows how, to a certain extent, anxiety can be useful and beneficial, and why it shouldn’t be seen as something purely negative. If you find yourself with around 90 minutes to spare, it could be an engaging and lighthearted watch.
