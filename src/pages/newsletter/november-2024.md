**Funding Progress**Â  Â Securing additional funding has been a major focus for our team recently. While weâ€™ve encountered a few rejections (which we see as valuable learning experiences), weâ€™re delighted to share some great news:Â **UWE Bristolâ€™s College of Arts, Technology and Environment (CATE)Â has awarded us an additional small grant!**Â ðŸŽ‰ With this funding secured we will be able to progress our plan at a more regular pace over the coming months.

**Networking Expansion**

Iâ€™m pleased to share that Iâ€™ve recently become a postgraduate member of theÂ [Experimental Psychology Society (EPS)](https://eps.ac.uk/about/). This membership offers access to valuable resources, funding opportunities, and a network of researchers, all of which I believe will benefit our co-design project.

**Co-Design Sessions**

**a. For Clinicians and Informal Carers**

Weâ€™re currently conducting 30-minute online interviews with clinicians and carers. These sessions are designed to offer maximum flexibility to accommodate your busy schedules given that we currently have lower recruitment in these groups. If youâ€™re interested in participating,Â **we still have availability**Â for both carers and clinicians. Simply reply to this email with your preferred time and day: Iâ€™d be delighted to hear from you!

**b. For People with lived experience of Anxiety Disorders**

Next week, weâ€™ll hold the final Phase I co-design workshops for individuals with lived experience of anxiety disorders. If youâ€™re interested in joining these sessions, please refer to the email with the date options I sent recently, or feel free to reply to this email: Iâ€™d be happy to forward the details to you!
