**🚀 New PPIE Network at UWE**

This month, we had the first meeting of the CHSS - Public Engagement in Research Network, a newly established group at UWE focused on Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE). This is an exciting step forward!

**Why this matters:**

- It strengthens collaboration among researchers working in PPIE, including co-design projects.
- It helps improve the quality and impact of our activities.
- It contributes to shaping clearer university policies (e.g., payments for public contributors, ethical applications).

We are also thrilled that our project will be featured in the first seminar of the network at the end of the month, a fantastic opportunity to gather valuable feedback and refine our future steps!

**🎤 Co-Design Phase I: Clinician Interviews Completed!**

**Following the completion of public co-design workshops in December, we have now conducted the final interviews with clinicians. A huge thank you to everyone who participated!**

**📢 Final Call: Carers' Interviews**

We still have a few 30-minute online interview slots available for unpaid/informal carers. Participants will receive a £15 voucher as a thank-you.

If you know someone who might be interested, please share this opportunity with them!

**🔍 Preparing for Co-Design Phase II**

As we wrap up Phase I, we are:

- Analyzing the rich insights gathered so far.
- Preparing materials to present at the beginning of each Phase II workshop and interview.
- Exploring the best approaches and methodologies to implement in the next stages.

Our goal is to ensure that all findings from Phase I directly inform and shape the next steps of our co-design process.
