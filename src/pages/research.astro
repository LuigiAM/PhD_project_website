const abstract = "Anxiety disorders consistently present challenges of under-/mis-diagnosis due to difficulties in differential diagnoses and the presence of common comorbidities. Standard self-reported approaches for assessing emotional regulation face criticism for their paradoxical nature, while semi-structured interviews may lack specificity and cross-cultural validity. This project explores if and how affective computing can address and mitigate the current issues.";

const objectives = [
  "To co-design a digital emotion-monitoring tool for individuals with anxiety disorders, enabling the collection of longitudinal data in real-world, daily contexts.",
  "To support clinical conversations.",
  "To support the interruption of anxiety loops.",
  "To support early help-seeking behaviour."
];

const methodology = "To address high dropout rates in digital mental health tools and focus on real needs, our co-design process involves people with anxiety disorders, unpaid carers, and clinicians across six phases, of which three have already been completed. Our approach focuses on the use of longitudinal emotion recognition data to identify anxiety patterns: from bio-signals (e.g. heart rate, galvanic skin response), along with user-generated data, like diaries and recordings, analysed for tone and content. Information from both mobilephones and wearables also allow to contexualise both the emotion data collected and the suggested coping strategies.";
