const abstract = "Anxiety disorders present persistent challenges of underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis due to difficulties in differential diagnoses and the presence of common comorbidities. Standard self-reported approaches for assessing emotional regulation face criticism for their paradoxical nature, while semi-structured interviews can lack specificity and cross-cultural validity. This project explores how affective computing can address and mitigate these issues.";
const objectives = [
  "To co-design a digital emotion-monitoring tool with and for individuals with anxiety disorders, enabling the collection of longitudinal data in real-world contexts.",
  "To provide structured, interpretable, and longitudinal data that can support and enrich clinical conversations.",
  "To support the interruption of anxiety loops.",
  "To support early help-seeking behaviour by improving emotional literacy."

const methodologyPart1 = "To address high dropout rates in digital mental health tools and focus on real-world needs, our co-design process involves people with anxiety disorders, unpaid carers, and clinicians across ";
const methodologyPart2 = ". Our approach focuses on using longitudinal emotion recognition data to identify anxiety patterns from bio-signals (e.g., heart rate, electrodermal activity) and user-generated data, such as diaries and recordings. Information from mobile phones and wearables allows us to contextualise both the emotion data collected and the suggested coping strategies.";
