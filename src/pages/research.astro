      <h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        To address high dropout rates in digital mental health tools and focus on real-world needs, our co-design process involves people with anxiety disorders, unpaid carers, and clinicians across <a href=`/achievements/#co-design-milestones`>six phases, of which three have already been completed</a>. Our approach focuses on using longitudinal emotion recognition data to identify anxiety patterns from bio-signals (e.g., heart rate, electrodermal activity) and user-generated data, such as diaries and recordings. Information from mobile phones and wearables allows us to contextualise both the emotion data collected and the suggested coping strategies.

        <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
        <div class="definition-item">
          <h4>What are Anxiety Disorders?</h4>
          <p>Anxiety Disorders are a group of mental health conditions characterized by significant feelings of anxiety and fear. These include Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Panic Disorder (PD), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and Social Phobia (or Social Anxiety Disorder, SAD). To illustrate the scale of the issue, approximately one in ten people in the UK are affected (Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey, 2014), yet these conditions remain significantly under- and misdiagnosed due to clinical complexity and comorbidities <a href="#reference-3" class="citation-link">[3]</a>.</p>

          <h4>What is Affective Computing?</h4>
          <p>A field of computer science that studies and explores emotions and their components. It involves developing systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects, often by analyzing physiological and behavioral signals. Research consistently shows that in this field, multimodal approaches (using multiple data sources) tend to outperform unimodal ones <a href="#reference-3" class="citation-link">[3]</a>.</p>

        <h2>Insights from Our Research</h2>
        <div class="qna-item">
          <h4>What are the common technologies used for emotion recognition in anxiety research?</h4>
          <p>Current research often relies on analyzing bio-signals collected from wearable devices. The most prevalent approaches quantify emotion using a model of valence (positive vs. negative) and arousal (intensity). Many existing studies have a strong focus on specific conditions like Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), showing the potential for these technologies in targeted clinical applications, and trans-diagnostic approaches are also promising <a href="#reference-3" class="citation-link">[3]</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="qna-item">
          <h4>What are the main opportunities for this technology in mental health?</h4>
          <p>The literature highlights a significant opportunity to use affective computing to enhance and support traditional care. Key applications include monitoring treatment progression in therapies like CBT, assessing the efficacy of advanced treatments, and most importantly, fostering a more patient-centric approach by enhancing the quality of the interaction between clinicians and patients <a href="#reference-3" class="citation-link">[3]</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="qna-item">
          <h4>How does MEMoPAD's approach address the current gaps?</h4>
          <p>While existing research is promising, many studies are conducted in controlled lab settings. MEMoPAD aims to address this by focusing on collecting longitudinal data in real-world contexts using consumer wearables. Furthermore, by emphasizing a co-design methodology from the very beginning, we ensure the final tool is not only technologically advanced but also truly usable, interpretable, and valuable to both individuals with anxiety and their clinicians <a href="#reference-3" class="citation-link">[3]</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="qna-item">
          <h4>Why focus on consumer wearable devices?</h4>
          <p>Our approach leverages consumer wearables for several key reasons: precision, as their in-built sensors become increasingly accurate; affordability, making scalable research possible; comfort, which is ideal for collecting longitudinal data over the long-term; and lack of stigma, as they are commonly used and not perceived as medical devices. Furthermore, research consistently shows that multimodal approaches (using multiple data sources from these devices) tend to outperform unimodal ones in affective computing <a href="#reference-3" class="citation-link">[3]</a>. This also aligns with the UK's 10-Year Health Plan: "We will make wearables standard in preventative, chronic and post-acute NHS treatment by 2035. All NHS patients will have access to these technologies, which will be part of routine care. We will provide devices for free in areas where health need and deprivation are highest" [4].</p>
