const abstract = "Anxiety disorders present persistent challenges of underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis due to difficulties in differential diagnoses and the presence of common comorbidities. Standard self-reported approaches for assessing emotional regulation face criticism for their paradoxical nature, while semi-structured interviews can lack specificity and cross-cultural validity. This project explores how affective computing can address and mitigate these issues.";

      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        To address high dropout rates in digital mental health tools and focus on real-world needs, our co-design process involves people with anxiety disorders, unpaid carers, and clinicians across <a href={`${BASE_URL}/achievements/#co-design-milestones`}>six phases, of which three have already been completed</a>. Our approach focuses on using longitudinal emotion recognition data to identify anxiety patterns from bio-signals (e.g., heart rate, electrodermal activity) and user-generated data, such as diaries and recordings. Information from mobile phones and wearables allows us to contextualise both the emotion data collected and the suggested coping strategies.

        <h2>Insights from Our Research</h2>
        <div class="qna-item">
          <h4>What are the common technologies used for emotion recognition in anxiety research?</h4>
          <p>Current research often relies on analyzing bio-signals collected from wearable devices. The most prevalent approaches quantify emotion using a model of valence (positive vs. negative) and arousal (intensity). Many existing studies have a strong focus on specific conditions like Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), showing the potential for these technologies in targeted clinical applications, and trans-diagnostic approaches are also promising [3].</p>
        </div>
        <div class="qna-item">
          <h4>What are the main opportunities for this technology in mental health?</h4>
          <p>The literature highlights a significant opportunity to use affective computing to enhance and support traditional care. Key applications include monitoring treatment progression in therapies like CBT, assessing the efficacy of advanced treatments, and most importantly, fostering a more patient-centric approach by enhancing the quality of the interaction between clinicians and patients [3].</p>
        </div>
        <div class="qna-item">
          <h4>How does MEMoPAD's approach address the current gaps?</h4>
          <p>While existing research is promising, many studies are conducted in controlled lab settings. MEMoPAD aims to address this by focusing on collecting longitudinal data in real-world contexts using consumer wearables. Furthermore, by emphasizing a co-design methodology from the very beginning, we ensure the final tool is not only technologically advanced but also truly usable, interpretable, and valuable to both individuals with anxiety and their clinicians [3].</p>
