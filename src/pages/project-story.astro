      This journey began with a personal truth: watching loved ones navigate the complexities of mental healthcare. Faced with their long-term struggles and feeling powerless to help, I saw an urgent need for better tools and a more empathetic system—an opportunity to make a meaningful difference that could not be ignored.

    <p>
      The first step was a feature for my previous startup, IntelliHearts: a one-lead ECG emotion recognition tool designed to reduce the high drop-off rates common in digital health apps. Unexpectedly, the feature generated more excitement than the core product, with users, investors, and experts all highlighting its standalone potential for clinical use.

      This spark of interest led me to pursue the idea with academic rigor. During my MSc, my project supervisor, David Western, and viva examiner, Michael Loizou, saw the potential and encouraged my application for a PhD scholarship at UWE Bristol. With their support, and now joined by the multidisciplinary expertise of Miles and Paul, this research was born.

    <p>
      Technology built in a vacuum often fails. Our foundation is built on listening. We use a co-design methodology, actively partnering with patients, clinicians, and carers at every stage. Their lived experiences and professional insights are not just feedback—they are the blueprint for building a tool that is truly relevant, safe, and effective.
